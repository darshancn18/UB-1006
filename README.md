AI Life Navigator is a smart governance platform designed to simplify access to government welfare schemes for citizens. Many people are unaware of the benefits they are eligible for due to complex eligibility criteria and scattered information across multiple sources. This platform solves that problem by collecting essential user details such as age, income level, caste category, and district, and then intelligently analyzing this data to recommend relevant government schemes. Instead of manually searching through numerous websites or documents, users receive personalized scheme suggestions in one place. By reducing information gaps and improving accessibility, AI Life Navigator promotes transparency, efficiency, and inclusive governance, ensuring that the right benefits reach the right people at the right time.
